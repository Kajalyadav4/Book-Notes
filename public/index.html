          I read a lot of books but after I finish reading them I often don't
          remember all the most salient parts of the book. So I started taking
          notes. This capstone project is built on this idea. Thus, I created
          this fantastic website where I've all the fiction and non-fiction
          books I have read, their notes, their ratings and when I have read
          them. The books are sortable by rating, recency and title.
