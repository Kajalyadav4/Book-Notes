# Book Notes

**Book Notes** is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to log books they’ve read, take personal notes, assign ratings, and view a sortable reading list — all stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## Why This Project

After finishing books, I often struggled to recall key takeaways. This project was built as a personal tool to help track what I’ve read, preserve insights, and revisit favorite reads. It also served as a capstone to practice building a structured web app using only frontend technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – page structure and form inputs
- **CSS** – layout, responsive design, and styling
- **JavaScript** – dynamic UI updates, sorting logic, and data persistence
- **localStorage API** – stores all book data in the browser
